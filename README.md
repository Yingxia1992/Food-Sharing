# Food-Sharing
The system is made up of a Web based platform(website) called FeedME , where all
the food sharing activities will take place. Users will be able to post pictures of
whatever food item they wish to share, along with a picture, a brief description and a
location. This will enable people who need them to be able to contact them,
communicate with them and arrange a convenient pickup time and location.

The system will allow users to register and log into their own accounts, manage their
profiles and select their location and favourite food. Once they login, the foods to be
offered can be shared on this system with photos and specific files if necessary.
Through keywords such as location and item type, users can view or rearrange (sort or
filter) the search results in a list or interactive map and to go the item page through
clicking. In the item page, the details of items are displayed and users can talk to the
sharer, “like” and also “request” the item. In addition, this software can automatically
notify users once their favourite food type is being shared and make intelligent
suggestions to them if they share the same item too many times.

In terms of FeedME, its Intelligent sorting function (such as filtering by distance, date
and popularity) is convenient for users, and enables them to see what they want in a
short time. Also, the search result showing in a map helps users see the locations
directly. In addition, users can access new notifications as soon as they are shared to
make sure that food can be delivered in the best time. Since all the services are free
for users, it can help more people in need. Based on P2P model which saves time and
labour from middle part, the system has a higher efficiency.
